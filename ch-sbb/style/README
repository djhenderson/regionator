style.kml:

  This is the target of styleUrl.  If this file is missing there is no style.

  Copy or symlink any of the other kml files in this directory to 'style.kml'
  for the effect as indicated for each.

  The richness of style features progresses with each file in
  the order described here.

icon.kml:

  Specify a custom icon.

rollover.kml:

  Builds on icon.kml and adds a custom icon for highlight/rollover.

label.kml:

  Builds on rollover.kml to hide the label until icon is highlighted.
  In addition the label is colored randomly.

balloon.kml:

  This builds on label.kml to set the balloon color, use simple
  rich text and entity replacement.

poly.kml

  This builds on balloon.kml to reveal geometry on rollover.
  This answers:
  1) How do I let someone select a polygon?  You can't.  But,
     you can put the Polygon in a MultiGeometry with a Point
     such that the user can get a balloon for the overall Placemark
     and/or provide rollover effects to reveal or hide or highlight
     or otherwise style the Polygon(s) (or LineStrings, etc) differently
     for normal vs highlight.
  2) What's MultiGeometry for?  See item 1.
