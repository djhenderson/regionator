This shows some ways to present a sample large dataset of
15,000 Swiss transit stations and the 18,000 connections between them.


Short form:

1) sh regionate.sh
2) open ch-sbb.kml


Long form:

ch-stations.csv:
  "CSV" file of 15,000 transit station locations and count
  of connections per day.

ch-connections.csv:
  "CSV" file of 18,000 connections between transit stations.


There are 3 programs to "regionate" this data:

regionator-basic.sh:
  RbNL hierarchy of stations using standard csvregionator with no styling.

regionator-style.sh:
  RbNL hiearchy of stations with styleUrl per Placemark to global shared style.

regionator-multi.py:
  RbNL hierarchy of station points and lines for connections using
  global shared style.


Open this file in Google Earth to view the result:

ch-sbb.kml:
  A radio folder to each of the 3 RbNL hierachies.
