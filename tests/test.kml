<name>Regionator tests $Revision$</name>

<Snippet maxLines="10">
This is a set of NetworkLinks to Regionator test cases.
It may make sense to enable/disable each test separately.
Note, this folder is listItemType=checkOffOnly.

This is a 4 level hierarchy of LineStrings over the USA.
The visibility range is 3 levels (minLodPixels=256, maxLodPixels=2048).
The LineStrings fade on both ends of the visibility range.

<Snippet maxLines="10">
This is a 5 level Region NetworkLink hierarchy of Placemarks.
Visibility accumulates down the hierarchy -- once visible
a Placemark remains so as range decreases (as projected
Region size increases).
Enable the following two tests along with this one for
two ways to visualize the active Regions.

This is a set of ScreenOverlays drawn relative to
geographic location and hierachy depth using
the same Regions as the preceeding two tests.
The overlay color ranges from blue to red
as hierarchy depth increases.

This is a Region hierarchy of LineStrings arranged by &quot;size&quot;.
The Lods are set to accumulate down the hierarchy.
LineStrings fade at the minimum end of the Lod range.
The hierarchy maximum depth is 9 levels.
Enable the next item for a visualization of the Region hiearchy.

This is a hierachy of Folders each with a Region inserted
whose LatLonAltBox sweeps out a bounding box around
all Placemark Points within the Folder.
There is a LineString &quot;box&quot; drawn for each Region.
(The arrangement of Placemarks in the original Folder
hierarchy is arbitrary).

This shows WMS tiles in GroundOverlays.
Enable the &quot;WMS&quot; folder to show the images
fetched directly from within a GroundOverlay.
Enable the &quot;local file &quot; folder to show the images
as local files pre-loaded from the WMS server.
Switching between the two folders reveals
exactly the same images.
