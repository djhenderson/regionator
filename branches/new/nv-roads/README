1. Run the extractor: ./extract-streets-kml.sh
   This will unzip the north-vancouver-streets file and invoke ogr2ogr to
   extract the KML file in the correct projection. You'll also need to have
   proj4 installed.

2. Run the parser: ./parse-streets-kml.py
   This separates the roads into specific types, restyles them and surrounds
   each with a <Region> such that the general effect is of larger roads
   becoming visible sooner. (An effect best observed by loading the output KML
   files into Google Earth...)
