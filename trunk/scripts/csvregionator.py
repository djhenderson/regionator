Regionate pipe-delimited data, sorted by score.

General usage is:
  ./csvregionator.py data.csv out.kml outdir

The minimum supplied data are in this format:
score|lat|lon|name|description

Additionally, a 6th row may be supplied in the csv file to define a
<styleUrl> for each placemark:
score|lat|lon|name|description|styleUrl

In this case, the styleUrl should use a relative href to point to a file at
the top-level of the generated directory structure, or should point to a kml
file over http.

It is also possible to supply a global styleUrl to script as a 4th argument:
  ./csvregionator data.csv out.kml outdir http://path/to/mystyles.kml#myStyle

In this case, the global styleUrl will be applied to each line in csvfile where
a styleUrl has not been explicitly defined. An explicitly defined styleUrl
overrides the global styleUrl.
